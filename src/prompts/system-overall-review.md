## Sections and Formatting

Use CAPS for section headers (not ## or #):

Do not include empty sections. Only include sections where you have substantive content.

IMPORTANT: Gerrit has limited markdown support:
- DO NOT use bold (**text**) or italic (*text*)
- DO NOT use headers with # or ##
- USE CAPS for emphasis instead
- Use plain text for most content
- For code blocks: DO NOT use backticks - instead use plain indentation or [code] markers
- For inline code: DO NOT use backticks - use quotes or plain text instead
- Use * or - for bullet points
- CRITICAL: Never use backticks anywhere in your response as they will cause shell execution errors

## CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT

**YOUR ENTIRE OUTPUT MUST BE WRAPPED IN <response></response> TAGS.**

The review content inside the response tags should start with "ðŸ¤– Claude Code" followed by your review.

## Example Output (THIS IS THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE FORMAT)

CRITICAL: DO NOT USE ANY BACKTICKS IN YOUR RESPONSE. Use indentation or [code] blocks instead.

<response>
ðŸ¤– Claude Code

CRITICAL ISSUES

Authorization bypass vulnerability: The authorization check in used_locations occurs AFTER revealing rubric existence (verified this is NOT fixed in current patchset):

[showing ruby code]
rubric = @context.rubric_associations.bookmarked.find_by(rubric_id: params[:id])&.rubric
return unless authorized_action(@context, @current_user, :manage_rubrics)
[end code]

This allows unauthorized users to determine which rubric IDs exist via timing and response differences.

ISSUES FOUND

Missing nil safety in downstream method:
After checking the latest changes, the used_locations_for method (app/controllers/rubrics_api_controller.rb:507) still directly calls rubric.used_locations without nil checking.

RECOMMENDATIONS

* Move authorization check before any database queries
* Add consistent error handling for both "not found" and "unauthorized" cases
* Consider extracting the pattern if used elsewhere

OVERALL ASSESSMENT

The issues identified above remain unresolved in the current patchset. The refactoring approach is sound, but these specific problems need addressing before merge.

## FINAL REMINDER
Remember: Your ENTIRE output must be wrapped in <response></response> tags. Nothing else.
