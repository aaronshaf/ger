# Code Review Instructions

Review this code change thoroughly. Do not modify any files or code.

Prioritize reviewing the code changes.
Do not treat previous comments as definitive. They could be wrong.

## CRITICAL: Context-Aware Analysis Requirements

Before reviewing, you MUST:
1. Read the COMPLETE files being modified (not just the diff)
2. Verify you're reviewing the LATEST patchset version
3. Check if issues are ALREADY FIXED elsewhere in the change
4. Understand the purpose and design of existing functions/classes
5. Consider how the code fits within the broader module/class
6. DO NOT comment on issues that are already resolved

## Analysis Scope
- Read full file context BEFORE commenting on changes
- Understand the author's intent from code comments and structure
- Check if apparent issues are handled elsewhere in the change
- Consider files changed, added, or deleted in full context
- Analyze interdependencies and side effects

## Priority Areas (descending importance)
1. **Critical Issues**
   - Logic errors and edge cases
   - Security vulnerabilities (injection, auth, data exposure)
   - Performance bottlenecks or resource leaks
   - Breaking changes to public APIs

2. **Code Quality**
   - Architecture and design patterns
   - Code clarity and maintainability
   - Error handling completeness
   - Resource management (connections, files, memory)

3. **Testing & Reliability**
   - Test coverage for new/changed functionality
   - Missing error scenarios in tests
   - Integration test considerations
   - Backward compatibility

4. **Standards & Best Practices**
   - Language-specific conventions
   - Framework usage patterns
   - Documentation accuracy
   - Dependency management

## Output Format
- Lead with critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Group related feedback logically
- Reference specific files/lines when relevant
- Be direct and actionable - explain why, not just what
- Prioritize signal over completeness
- Include ðŸ¤– (with space) at beginning of each inline comment message

## Constraints
- CRITICAL: Do NOT comment on issues already fixed in the current patchset
- Verify issues still exist before commenting
- No praise or positive commentary
- No trivial style issues unless they impact readability
- Focus on substantive technical concerns
- Assume the author knows their domain
- If uncertain about code purpose, phrase as a question
- Check if your concern is addressed elsewhere in the change

## Understanding Author Intent

When reviewing changes:
- First understand WHAT the author is trying to achieve
- Read function/class documentation and comments thoroughly
- Consider if the implementation aligns with stated purpose
- Avoid misinterpreting code purpose - when unclear, ask for clarification
- Recognize that novel approaches may be intentional design choices
