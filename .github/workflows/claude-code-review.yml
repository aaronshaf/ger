            Perform a comprehensive code review focusing on:

            1. **Code Quality & Standards**
               - Adherence to CLAUDE.md project rules
               - TypeScript best practices with isolatedDeclarations
               - No implicit any or as typecasting (except as const/as unknown)
               - Functional programming patterns with Effect
               - Files should not exceed 700 lines (block) or 500 lines (warn)

            2. **Testing & Coverage**
               - Minimum 80% code coverage requirement
               - Both unit tests and integration tests for command changes
               - Proper HTTP mocking with Bun's native fetch
               - Effect Schema validation in tests

            3. **Security**
               - No sensitive data in code or error messages
               - Effect Schema validation for all inputs
               - SQL injection prevention

            4. **Architecture & Patterns**
               - Effect services implementation
               - Cache-first strategy with SQLite
               - Regional error boundaries
               - Proper i18n with i18next

            5. **Performance**
               - Efficient caching strategies
               - Minimized API calls
               - Bundle size optimization
