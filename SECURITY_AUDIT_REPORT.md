# Security & Privacy Audit Report

**Audit Date:** August 21, 2025
**Repository:** Gerrit CLI (ger)
**Status:** âœ… PASSED - Critical issues resolved

## Executive Summary

The security and privacy audit has been completed with **all critical and high-priority issues resolved**. The repository is now secure for production use with proper credential handling, data protection, and privacy compliance.

## Audit Scope

âœ… **Credential Storage & Handling**
âœ… **Hardcoded Secrets Scanning** 
âœ… **Network Security & Authentication**
âœ… **Input Validation & Injection Prevention**
âœ… **Error Handling & Information Disclosure**
âœ… **Dependency Vulnerability Assessment**
âœ… **File Permissions & Configuration Security**
âœ… **Privacy Compliance (No sensitive data exposure)**

## Findings Summary

### ðŸŸ¢ RESOLVED - High Priority Issues

1. **Sensitive Information in Tests** - FIXED
   - **Issue**: Test files contained references to real company domains
   - **Resolution**: Replaced with example.com domains
   - **Files**: `src/utils/url-parser.test.ts`, `tests/unit/mocks/http-safety.test.ts`

2. **Documentation Security** - ENHANCED 
   - **Issue**: Password example could be misconstrued
   - **Resolution**: Clarified as example placeholder, added security warning
   - **Files**: `README.md`, `src/cli/commands/init.ts`

### ðŸŸ¢ SECURE - Existing Security Features

1. **Credential Storage** âœ…
   - Uses system keychain (keytar) for secure storage
   - No hardcoded credentials in source code
   - Proper credential validation with Effect Schema

2. **Network Security** âœ…
   - HTTPS-only connections
   - Proper Basic Authentication implementation
   - Input sanitization via `encodeURIComponent`
   - Protected against XSSI with Gerrit response prefix handling

3. **Input Validation** âœ…
   - All inputs validated using Effect Schema
   - URL parameters properly encoded
   - Change IDs validated before API calls

4. **Error Handling** âœ…
   - Errors don't expose credentials or sensitive data
   - Generic error messages for authentication failures
   - Structured error handling with Effect

5. **Test Security** âœ…
   - Mock safety prevents real API calls during testing
   - No real credentials in test files
   - Whitelist-based domain checking in tests

### ðŸŸ¡ INFORMATIONAL - Low Risk Items

1. **Development Dependencies** 
   - Some indirect dev dependencies (ast-grep chain) have known vulnerabilities
   - **Impact**: Development-only, does not affect production
   - **Recommendation**: Monitor for updates, consider alternative linting tools

2. **XML Output Security**
   - XML output uses CDATA sections to prevent injection
   - **Status**: Secure implementation
   - **Validation**: Proper escaping in place

## Security Improvements Made

1. **Removed Sensitive References**
   - Eliminated real company/domain names from test files
   - Updated documentation to use example domains only

2. **Enhanced Security Warnings**
   - Added credential safety warnings to setup process
   - Improved documentation security guidance

3. **Test Safety Hardening**
   - Improved domain whitelisting in test mocks
   - Prevented accidental real API calls

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created SECURITY.md with security practices
   - Enhanced README with LLM-centric security considerations

## Compliance Status

âœ… **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All credentials properly externalized
âœ… **No Sensitive Data Exposure**: Logs and errors sanitized  
âœ… **Privacy Compliant**: No personal/company data in repository
âœ… **Secure Authentication**: Proper credential storage and transmission
âœ… **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Completed âœ…)
- [x] Remove sensitive references from test files
- [x] Add security warnings to credential setup
- [x] Update documentation for security best practices
- [x] Create security policy documentation

### Future Monitoring
- [ ] Regular dependency audits (quarterly)
- [ ] Monitor ast-grep for security updates
- [ ] Review any new dependencies for vulnerabilities

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level: ðŸŸ¢ LOW**

- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **High Vulnerabilities**: 0 
- **Medium Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **Low/Informational**: 1 (dev dependencies only)

## Conclusion

The Gerrit CLI tool demonstrates excellent security practices with:
- Secure credential storage using system keychain
- Proper input validation and sanitization
- Secure network communications
- Good test safety practices
- No sensitive data exposure

All identified issues have been resolved, and the tool is ready for secure production use.
